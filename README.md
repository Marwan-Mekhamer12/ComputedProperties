# ComputedProperties

üë®‚Äçüíª Swift Computed Properties Practice (get/set)
Recently, I worked on a small Swift code snippet to deepen my understanding of computed properties using get and set.

In this example, I calculated the number of pizzas needed for a group, based on:

pizza size (in inches),
number of people,
and how many slices each person eats.
I used:

A computed property pizzaSlices with both get and set to dynamically compute slice count and optionally respond to changes.
Another computed property numberOfPizza with a get block to calculate how many pizzas are needed.
This helped reinforce how to apply computed properties in real-world logic and how get and set can be customized to manage dynamic data in Swift.
